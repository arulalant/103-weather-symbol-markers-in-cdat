Dear All,

You need to do few steps to install these new weather markers inside your CDAT.

It takes just less than 5 minutes to install this.

Let us assume, you have CDAT source in your home folder and right now you are in this weather marker source folder. ok


$ cp vcs_marker.h  ~/cdat-source/Packages/vcs/Include/

$ cp VCS_validation_functions.py  ~/cdat-source/Packages/vcs/Lib/

$ cp vcsmodule.c    ~/cdat-source/Packages/vcs/Src/

$ cp markers.c      ~/cdat-source/Packages/vcs/Src/library/


Now you are copied the new modified markers source and its dependencies files.


$ cd ~/cdat-source/Packages/vcs/

Now you can rebuild the vcs module by itself by running the following...

$ rm -rf build
$ /path/to/your_cdat_installed_location/python/bin/python setup.py build install

example:

In my system, I installed the cdat into the path in  /usr/local/cdat5.2/bin

so that I can install by $ sudo /usr/local/cdat5.2/bin//cdat  setup.py build install


Once you done this, you can call the 103 weather symbol markers in your cdat programs.

Please read the Documentation and Example Markers - Programs.

Thats all. :-)
