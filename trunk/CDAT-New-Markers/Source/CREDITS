Dear All,

This is "Arulalan Thanigachalam" from India.

I have created 103 new markers in CDAT [ Climate Data Analysis Tools ].

I created these markers for to plot the “Weather Symbols” over CDAT World Map or Continents.

I got the help  from "Mr.Charles Doutriaux", Developer of CDAT  how to create new markers in source of CDAT and how to compile into the pre installed cdat location itself.

I am thanking him.

Thanks to CDAT team.!.
